# Basket League
## Author: Michał Kaźmierczak

### This is a python game project for Applied Mathematics Programming course.
## The game was created as a combination of my two passions: basketball and python programming.
## Rules are simple: Try to score as many points as you can :) ..and remember - the farther from the basket, the harder it is to hit.
## Controls:
* LEFT - move player left
* RIGHT - move player right
* SPACE - throw a ball
* DOWN (without the ball) - get a new ball
* ESC - eqit game
## Good luck and have fun ! :D
